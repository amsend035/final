                                The national flag of Indonesia is a simple bicolor with two horizontal bands, red (top) and white (bottom).
                                It was introduced and hoisted in public during the proclamation of independence on 17 August 1945. 
                                The design of the flag has remained unchanged since.

                                <p>
                                The flag of Indonesia is graphically similar to the flag of Monaco, with a slight difference in the shade of red, and ratio of its dimensions.
                                The flag of Poland has similar dimensions but has the colours reversed: white on top and red on the bottom.
                                In both Monaco's and Poland's flags, the reds are of a slightly darker shade than that of Indonesia.

                                Several opinions have been expressed on the meaning of the red and white in the Indonesian flag.
                                One of them is that the red stands for courage, while the white stands for purity.
                                Another opinion is that red represents the human body or physical life, while white represents the soul or spiritual life; together they stand for a complete human being.

                                The active volcano sits in the middle of a plain called the Sea of Sand (Segara Wedi), along with several other mountains.
                                This active volcano has an iconic blown-off top from recurring eruptions, resulting in a stunning mountain landscape emitting sulfurous smoke, one of the most popular and photographed scenes from Indonesia.

                                It has a picturesque landscape of hills, lush vegetations, exotic coastlines, and clear blue ocean, all in one glance.

                                The population of Indonesia was 270.20 million according to the 2020 national census, an increase from 237.64 million in 2010.
                                Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world.
                                Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.
                                This rapid population growth has led to a myriad of challenges, and one of the most prominent issues is the alarming rise in traffic congestion.
                                The surge in urbanization and economic activities in major cities has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the number of vehicles on the roads.
