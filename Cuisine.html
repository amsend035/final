            <div class="caption">
                Indonesian and Malaysian cuisines are renowned for their rich tapestry of flavors, owing much of their distinctiveness to the abundant use of spices and herbs in daily meals.<br>
                These culinary traditions embrace a wide array of aromatic ingredients.<br>
                The robust combination of herbs and spices elevates each bite, offering a sensory experience that is both bold and nuanced.

            <div class="caption">
                Cendol is an iced sweet dessert that contains droplets of green rice flour jelly, coconut milk and palm sugar syrup.<br>
                At its core, cendol is a traditional drink originating from Malaysia and Indonesia, but variations can be found throughout Southeast Asia.<br>

            <h2>Curry</h2>
            <div class="caption">
                Southeast Asian curry and Japanese curry exhibit distinct characteristics that set them apart in terms of flavor and ingredients.<br>
                Japanese curry, influenced by British and Indian culinary traditions, often relies on a unique curry powder and is often thicker and heartier, creating a comforting and filling consistency.<br>
                In contrast, Southeast Asian curries showcase a vibrant array of spices, herbs, and aromatics, and tend to be more fluid with coconut milk frequently used as a base, imparting a creamy texture.

                Ketupat, a traditional rice cake widely enjoyed in various Southeast Asian countries.<br>
                This iconic dish is made by weaving young coconut leaves into a diamond-shaped container, which is then filled with rice and boiled until it becomes a compact, glutinous mass.<br>
